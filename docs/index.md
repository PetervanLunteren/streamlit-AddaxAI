# AddaxAI Documentation

## Official Documentation Coming Soon

Welcome to the AddaxAI documentation site! We're currently working on comprehensive documentation for this wildlife camera analysis platform.

### What is AddaxAI?

AddaxAI is a Streamlit-based wildlife camera trap analysis platform that automates animal detection and species classification using AI models. It processes camera trap deployments (SD card image collections) through a complete AI-powered workflow, replacing manual review of thousands of images.

**Core Value**: Automates the bottleneck in wildlife research - manually reviewing camera trap images - enabling researchers to focus on conservation decisions rather than image sorting.

### Current Status

ðŸ“š **Documentation Status**: Under Development  
ðŸš€ **Application Status**: Fully Functional  
ðŸ”§ **Platform**: macOS (with future cross-platform support planned)
