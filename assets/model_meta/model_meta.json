            "description": "SpeciesNet is an image classifier designed to accelerate the review of images from motion-triggered wildlife cameras ('camera traps'). This classifier was trained at Google using a large dataset of camera trap images and an EfficientNet V2 M architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00574). It is designed to classify images into one of more than 2000 labels, covering diverse animal species, higher-level taxa (like 'mammalia' or 'felidae'), and non-animal classes ('blank', 'vehicle'). The SpeciesNet classifier is typically run in an ensemble with MegaDetector (https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector), an object detector that identifies the locations and types of objects present in camera trap images, categorizing them as animals, humans, or vehicles. The SpeciesNet ensemble combines these two models using a set of heuristics and, optionally, geofencing rules and taxonomic aggregation that take into account the geographical origin of the image to improve the reliability of its species classification. This ensemble is used for image classification in the Wildlife Insights platform (https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/).",

The model was trained on 2,000 camera trap images per class (mostly from LILA BC, https://lila.science/). The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are all at 90% for the test set (250 images per class), though performance varies somewhat by species. Camera trap images for some species were unavailable so that images of 'substitute' species had to be used, and local images were not available for training as well, i.e. the model's ability to generalize to the target region remains to be tested. The model is based on a pre-trained EfficientNetV2M. It follows MEWC for image preparation (relying on MegaDetector) and model training. The model was designed to support Bengal tiger conservation.",

The model is designed for wildlife identification across savannas, dry forests, arid shrublands, and semi-desert habitats. Training data includes images from South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Rwanda, Madagascar, and Uganda.

The initiative is led by a core academic team from the French 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique' (CNRS), in collaboration with more than 50 European partners involved in wildlife research, conservation and management. The Deepfaune models can be run through a custom software freely available on the website, or through other software packages or platforms like EcoAssist. New versions of the model are published regularly, increasing classification accuracy or adding new species to the list of species that can be recognized.

It is based on the EfficientNet v2 Small model architecture, initialised with pre-trained ImageNet base weights. The classes include all non-volant terrestrial mammals (native and introduced) that are found in Tasmania, along with over 50 of the most-commonly observed bird species seen on camera traps. Most classes represent species, but there are also some general classes like snake or insect, and an unknown/washed-out special class. Based on held-out test data, the overall classification accuracy and f1 scores are >99%, and for the common species, accuracy typically exceeds 99.5%. The results for the rarest taxa are worse, but still over 90% in almost all cases.",

If you're starting from scratch and you want the safe thing that has been studied extensively in the literature, use MDv5a. If you want to join me on the cutting edge and see some bananas-good recall, use MDv1000-redwood. Only use the smaller model MDv1000-spruce if you're sure you need them. Faster sounds better, but in a world where a regular laptop with no GPU can process 50k images per day even through MDv5, and GPUs than can do 1M images per day come standard on home PCs now, the scenario where speed makes a qualitative difference is niche, and if in practice running 2x faster means you need to lower your confidence threshold to preserve recall, you've reduced compute time to increase human time, which is almost never a tradeoff you want to make.",
